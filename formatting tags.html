  <h2> <a href="">Understanding HTML Formatting Tags</a></h2>

  <p>HTML<a href=""> (Hypertext Markup Language)</a> is the cornerstone of web pages. It defines the structure and content of your website, allowing you to create<a href=""> headings, paragraphs, lists, </a>and more. Formatting tags are like special instructions embedded within your HTML code that tell browsers how to display specific elements. Hashnode's built-in editor makes using these tags a breeze, but understanding their underlying functionality can be empowering.</p>

  <h2><a href="">Essential Formatting Tags</a></h2>

  <p>Now, let's explore some of the most commonly used formatting tags:</p>

  <h3><a href="">Headings (h1-h6)</a></h3>

  <p>These tags create headings of different sizes, with `h1` being the largest and most prominent, and `h6` being the smallest. Use them to structure your <a href="">content, organize main ideas, </a>and improve readability.</p>
